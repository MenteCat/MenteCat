### Hi there 👋

- 👩‍💻  I recently completed Le Wagon Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp
- 👩‍🎓  I’m planning to learn React
- 🤿  I’m looking forward to dive deeper in JavaScript
- 📚  I worked on 3 different projects using Ruby on Rails.
- 🔍  Searching small projects/collaborations to get started with the post-Bootcamp life!
- 💬  Always up for a good chat/receive friendly advices
- 📫  How to reach me: tinaiuso@gmail.com

- ⚡ Fun fact: before signing up to GitHub I was genuinly convinced that "Pull requests" was named "Poor requests" as I misheard a developer.
